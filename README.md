# Deep-Learning


A collection of experiments covering fundamental Deep Learning concepts, from NumPy-based feedforward networks and activation functions to Keras implementations of MLP image classifiers and LSTM time-series prediction.

* **Core Components: Activation and Loss:** Analyze and implement fundamental functions crucial for training, including **Activation Functions**  and **Loss Functions** .
* **Image Classification with MLPs:** Build and train a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** model using Keras/TensorFlow to perform a standard image classification task on the **Fashion MNIST** dataset.
* **Model Optimization and Tuning:** Conduct an experiment to compare the performance and convergence of various **optimizers** to identify the most efficient method for a specific model.
* **Sequential Data Prediction (LSTM):** Implement an advanced **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** Recurrent Neural Network for **time-series forecasting**, demonstrated through a practical example of **stock price prediction**.
